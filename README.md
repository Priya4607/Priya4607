- âš¡ Fun fact: In modern rhetoric sense, beg the question is often misunderstood as a "question that needs to be answered". However in the sense employed by Aristotle's *On Sophistical Refutations*, it simply means to "assume the conclusion". It is used to term a logical fallacy in which an argument's premise assumes the very first thing it's trying to prove.
